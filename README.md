This repository hosts the [MIME Sniffing Standard](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `Overview.src.html` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments"
here (I know). Also, the MIME Sniffing Standard uses [Anolis](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Anolis)
to generate `Overview.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request
does not need to contain the generated HTML.)
